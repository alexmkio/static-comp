# Static Comp

Static Comp was a Mod 2 solo challenge in the Front End program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). The assignment was to build out an application to pixel perfection using only a screenshot of the desktop version of the site. No assets, fonts, sizing, spacing, color codes, etc. Nothing! What a lovely design team!

The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp).
